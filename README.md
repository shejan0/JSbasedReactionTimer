# JavaScript Reaction Game
## Developed by Shejan Shuza

This project is a system based on creating a functional reaction timer game with basic score keeping via mySQL database.

I had accidently deleted the database when updating mySQL but I believe it to be rather simple and easy to implement:

id-A automatically incrementing ID for what current insert

rtime-integer number that is large enough for the average of 100s of ms difference

uname-a small string used for the entered username

date-a current date that this score was inserted on.

The database doesn't neccessarily have to be secured in anyway since it doesn't record any personal information.

The favicon.ico is the icon from Wallpaper Engine 2.0 which I do not own and is rightfully held to its creators.
